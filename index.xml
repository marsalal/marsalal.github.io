If you are not a developer or someone with the extra curiosity to learn by yourself; its highly probable that you either dont do it or dont want to hire someone to do it for you.</description></item><item><title>Who am I?</title><link>https://marsalal.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marsalal.github.io/about/</guid><description>Software developer with more than 12+ years of experience; I have had the opportunity to work in almost all spectre of an application: mobile, web &amp;amp; back-end. Most of the time I have spent has been in back-end projects where C# and .Net technologies have been my specialities.
Also I have performed as tech lead for small and multi-region teams with different seniorities, always looking to increase the potential of each member and to reach the team&amp;rsquo;s goals.</description></item></channel></rss>
