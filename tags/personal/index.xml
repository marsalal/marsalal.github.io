The 2022 year will be in a special place in my heart because of all the good things that happened and all the memories created during all 12 months.
Hey, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, we had our difficulties to overcome and hard moments, but somehow I feel this year was at some level better than the last one.</description></item><item><title>2021 Highlights</title><link>https://marsalal.github.io/post/2021-highlights/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marsalal.github.io/post/2021-highlights/</guid><description>This 2021 year has been both special and somehow bitter for me, which I guess its something that most of you could relate. I&amp;rsquo;ve always believe that not all the time you can have good times and good experiences, even if it happens for a long time eventually something wont come out as you expect and you need to accept it. So, lets start with what went bad/not-expected/dissapointing things
The bad things Month What sucked?</description></item><item><title>Our 2021 marathon journey</title><link>https://marsalal.github.io/post/chicago-marathon-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marsalal.github.io/post/chicago-marathon-2021/</guid><description>My journey to complete a marathon in 2021 was planned in a very different way than it tuned out to be, it all began during April 2021 when the Rotterdam organization said that a full in-person marathon was going to take place in October 24th, 2021. That was a big motivation after what happened in March 2020 and then in October 2020, if you add the possibility of having vaccinated, our chances to go to the Netherlands and run the marathon have increased a LOT!</description></item></channel></rss>
