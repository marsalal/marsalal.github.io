I&amp;rsquo;ve always believe that not all the time you can have good times and good experiences, even if it happens for a long time eventually something wont come out as you expect and you need to accept it. So, lets start with what went bad/not-expected/dissapointing things

That was a big motivation after what happened in March 2020 and then in October 2020, if you add the possibility of having vaccinated, our chances to go to the Netherlands and run the marathon have increased a LOT!</description></item></channel></rss>
