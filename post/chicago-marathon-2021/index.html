That was a big motivation after what happened in March 2020 and then in October 2020, if you add the possibility of having vaccinated, our chances to go to the Netherlands and run the marathon have increased a LOT! We couldn&rsquo;t be happier and our training began in late May to have our standard 16-18 weeks of training.</p><p>After we spent our first half of the year running trails and experimenting with new courses and mountains that we had never run before, and some days off in Guanacaste, the build-up phase started. We have decided to include our MP (marathon pace) earlier from what we are used to starting running at the predicted/wanted pace. Usually, our coach leaves it for the final block (6-5 weeks), but we wanted to try something different and start feeling the pace to get used to it. I wanted to run between 4:30 km/m to finish the 42.1 km in approx 3:15 hrs and Cata was looking at her sub-4 marathon, which was roughly 5:36 km/m pace, which for the both of us wasn&rsquo;t something crazy or beyond our limits. It was something really possible!</p><p>What life and 2020 have taught us, is that anything can change in a blink of an eye, and it happened to us again. The government of the Netherlands in mid-September placed Costa Rica in his red list of countries that had restrictions to travel, which meant we could fly to the Netherlands but could be asked to have mandatory 10-day quarantine. What a bummer!</p><p>We decided not to that the risk and ruin all the hard work and sacrifices we did in our training, luckily, I called Marathon tours agency in Costa Rica to see if there was, at least minimal possibility, to have open registrations to Chicago marathon despite we only had 3-4 weeks to go.
Planets aligned and we had a 4-hour window to decide if we would want to go, after some time debating, we took the chance and we secure our registration to Chicago.</p><p>My wife and I signed in November 2019 to run the 40th edition of the Rotterdam Marathon and we got screwed, sort of speaking, twice by covid. Some day, we will run in Rotterdam, but we had a blast in Chicago. We were able to close a page to go back and run a marathon after almost 3 years of our last one (Berlin, 2018), and decided to go back again in 2022.</p><p>Life is and will be hard, no doubt of that, but we need to stay mentally strong to be prepared when our plans and hopes don&rsquo;t go as we expected. We need to master the skill of adapting and overcoming each time so we can still make our way in life. This was a huge lesson for both of us and another example to keep fighting for whatever we think is worth it.</p></div><h4 class=page-header>Related</h4><div class=item><h4><a href=/post/2022-highlights/>2022 Highlights</a></h4><div><div class=inline-block><p><img src=https://img.icons8.com/material-outlined/24/000000/clock--v1.png>3 min</p></div>|<div class=inline-block><h5>January 7, 2023</h5></div></div><a href=https://marsalal.github.iotags/personal><kbd class=item-tag>personal</kbd></a>
